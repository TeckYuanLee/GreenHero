# GreenHero - CodeathonX (Second Runner-up)

![Thank_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8788481/140861770-f7270958-1e5f-423d-a9c0-913a4356de3a.png)

Welcome to GreenHero, we use digital identity to influence green behaviors. 

GreenHero is a waste management app that helps developing cities increase the rates of waste collection and recycling by gamifying the waste management journey through a tiered reward system. We want to capture the rising trend of green consumers to solve the waste management problem that will emerge in developing countries and cities. 

Our current competitors are Recircle and Riiicycle which have basic features like recycling for cash and rewards. But what makes us standout is our trophy tracks the milestone of each individual and this is recognizable across the globe which brings limitless utility to this identity. 

For this to happen we are utilizing Non-Fungible Token (NFT) of the Blockchain Technology to create a unique identity that records every users' milestone. We are also using Flutter to develop our app prototype. We currently have a working prototype, a business plan with a clear way forward, and a team who shares the same vision for the project. We are looking for grants & partnerships to fund our initial operation and granting us a status recognition. 

That's it, if you're interested to learn more about our project, be sure to check out our [pitch deck](https://github.com/TeckYuanLee/GreenHero/blob/main/SDG11_GreenHero_GreenHero.pdf), thank you.
